          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
              salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
              tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat
              and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling,
              pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the
              surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the
              edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
              chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook,
              carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
              for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
